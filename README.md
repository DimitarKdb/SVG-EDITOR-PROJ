# Basic SVG File Editor

## Project Overview

This project is a C++-based SVG file editor designed to manipulate basic shapes such as rectangles, polygons, lines and etc. It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilizes design patterns to facilitate object creation and management. The structured design ensures that the project remains scalable and maintainable, allowing for easy integration of future features.

## Features

- **Shape Manipulation**: Support for basic shapes such as:
  - Rectangles
  - Polygons
  - Lines
  - ...
- **Operations**:
  - Resizing shapes
  - Moving shapes
  - Recoloring shapes
  - Scaling shapes
  - Grouping/ungrouping shapes
  - Saving shapes in different formats
  - ...

## Design Approach

The editor is built with scalability and maintainability in mind:

- **OOP Principles**: The project follows core OOP principles for code organization and modularity.
- **Design Patterns**: Used for efficient creation and management of shape objects, enabling future extensibility with minimal changes.

## Future Enhancements

This project is structured to accommodate new features, such as:

- Additional shape types
- Advanced editing capabilities
- Export to different file formats
